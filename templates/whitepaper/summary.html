  <h1>Summary</h1>

  <p>{{gettext("For the past two decades, Internet marketplaces have changed the way that buyers and sellers connect, creating new opportunities for the exchange of goods and services. However, these marketplaces have always been governed by centralized companies that maintain their individual monopolies on data, transaction and other service fees, and ultimately, user choice. With blockchain and other distributed technologies beginning to hit the mainstream, the world is poised for a new wave of decentralized commerce.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("Origin is bringing change and innovation to the sharing economy. We're excited by the opportunity to lower fees, increase innovation, free customer and transaction data, and decrease censorship and unnecessary regulation. Even if you are perfectly content with the centralized providers of today, what about the day when these monopolies stop being so benevolent? We hope you agree that future-proofing our world against oligarchs and tyrants is a worthwhile endeavor")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("We are building a platform that invites other interested parties including developers and entrepreneurs to build this technology and community with us, altogether working to create the sharing economy of tomorrow. We hope youâ€™ll join us on this exciting journey")}}</p>
