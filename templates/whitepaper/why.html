    <p>{{gettext("Since the advent of the Internet, digital marketplaces have paired buyers and sellers of goods and services to enable transactions that were never before possible. Craigslist launched in 1995 and for years dominated in local and neighborhood commerce. That same year, eBay was started and created an entirely new category of auction-based sales, creating a more market-efficient way to do business.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Fast forward 20 years, and countless Internet marketplace businesses in both the B2C and B2B categories have flourished.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("In recent times, sharing economy marketplaces like Airbnb, Uber, Getaround, WeWork, Fiverr, and TaskRabbit have paired buyers and sellers of the sharing economy1 with great success. Fractional usage of assets can now be “sold” just as easily as atomic items, and people all over the world are exchanging their excess inventory, time, and skills for financial gain.")}}</p>


    <p>{{gettext("These new marketplaces that focus on gigs, services, and fractional asset use are particularly well-suited for disruption by decentralized systems built on the blockchain.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Most sharing economy businesses have several things in common.")}}</p>

    <p>{{gettext("First, as a collection, these companies have created tremendous impact to the world. Consumers of marketplaces have been able to improve their lives with access to products and services that were not available previously. Suppliers have used these platforms to reach customers at greater scale and ease than before. Each marketplace creates a “home” for buyer and supplier to come together and transact, creating liquidity for that market.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Second, most sharing economy businesses follow the same growth lifecycle. Save for a few exceptions, these marketplaces are notoriously difficult to start and grow. Marketplace businesses oftentimes require millions of dollars to just get off the ground and, in the case of Uber and Airbnb, billions to scale. It’s the norm for these businesses to run at a deep loss in the early days. In effect, the corporation is subsidizing the usage of the marketplace for the participants. However, because of highly positive cross-side network effects, successful marketplace businesses are able to grow revenue exponentially over time, usually by charging a service fee for every transaction that happens on network. Network effect businesses, like sharing economy marketplaces, are usually winner-takes-all businesses and at mature stages extract a disproportionate amount of value from the network forthe managing corporations and their shareholders. In many ways, they begin looking like monopolies once they reach scale.")}}</p>

    <p>{{gettext("Finally, while there are very significant differences in user experience, business mechanics, and vertical-specific features among Internet marketplace companies, they all share many pieces that have been built and rebuilt many times. Lyft, Postmates, and DoorDash have each individually engineered their own solutions to user and supplier profiles, purchase experiences, matching algorithms, and reviews and ratings. This is valuable proprietary technology on the one hand. On the other, it is a wasteful use of time and effort to reinvent the wheel each time to create a new marketplace vertical. Consumers are also left creating and managing dozens of accounts on these marketplace companies, each of which owns their personal data and transaction history.")}}</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold">{{gettext("Unfair value capture")}}</p>
    
    <p>{{gettext("Value taken by today’s trusted intermediaries is oftentimes not commensurate with the value they create. In addition, value capture is concentrated to the network operators and not to the network participants.")}}</p>

    <p>{{gettext("As an example, we can examine Airbnb, which has built a business currently valued at a reported $38 billion. Airbnb has built an impressive technology platform that facilitates online bookings and reviews, as well as launched local operations teams to bootstrap and cultivate local markets. Even in 2017, the company boasted 4M short-term rental listings4. There’s no denying that Airbnb has added immense value to the ecosystem by supplying both bits and blocks to the ecosystem. The short-term home rental market would not exist without Airbnb having created it.")}}</p>

    <p>{{gettext("Today, the technology platform has been built and the marketplace grows organically with new hosts and users both proactively seeking out Airbnb’s website and mobile app. Airbnb charges guests 5-15%% and hosts 3-5%% of every booking. This means Airbnb will capture as much as 20%% of the value of every transaction regardless of whether additional work is being done by the company. Airbnb also automatically withholds local taxes as well, which can be significant. For example, the hotel taxes in Chicago, Atlanta, and Seattle are 16%%.")}}</p>

    <p>{{gettext("It’s worth noting that Airbnb is not alone in charging egregious fees for its matching service. Online travel agencies like Booking.com and Expedia charge affiliate hotels 15-30%% of transaction value")}}</p>

    <img src="/static/img/whitepaper/03.png" class="whitepaper-image" />

    <p>{{gettext("In this case, while buyer and seller are both better off than they would be without Airbnb, they are leaving money on the table since both sides would be willing to meet at a price somewhere in the middle. A more efficient market would exist if the transaction fees were removed or even decreased. Buyer and seller will both be better off economically as Airbnb is disintermediated.")}}</p>

    <p>{{gettext("Further, as Airbnb has thrived, it is the company’s shareholders that will reap the handsome rewards. The company’s founders, venture capitalists, and employees will make an immense amount of money in an IPO that is anticipated in 2020. But what about Airbnb’s earliest hosts that supplied liquidity to the market? Sure, they benefited by making revenue on the platform, but they are not getting outsized rewards for their integral contributions in the early days of the marketplace like employees and investors are. In a somewhat exaggerated analogy, the company is running a feudal system where its hosts act as serfs to overfill the network owner’s coffers.")}}</p>

We also believe that transparency is critical for trust. Too often corporations control access to their users’ own data for their own benefit. When guests set up a methamphetamine lab in an early Airbnb apartment, Airbnb’s team of lawyers immediately descended with non-disclosure agreements and hush money to stop the negative press from getting out. That might have been the right decision for Airbnb, but the company’s customers deserve to know the truth so they can make informed decisions with whom to transact business.

    <p>{{gettext("Once a category winner has been defined in marketplace verticals, that company is usually able to maintain a (mostly) monopolistic position. Having more buyers and sellers means more capital to further grow the business. Having invaluable troves of data, marketing dollars, and brand recognition are all powerful moats that prevent competitors from entering the market, thereby stifling innovation. The most salient example is probably Craigslist, the first mainstream services and goods marketplace on the Internet, which has thrived for over 20 years despite having an outdated user experience, lacking a dependable and trustworthy reputation system, and even failing to provide a native way to pay for transactions safely and easily.")}}</p>

Uber has increased their take from drivers from 15%% all the way to 30%% over the years7, and drivers have no ability to impact these decisions. Many early Uber drivers now feel that they have been taken advantage of as the ride-sharing giant has scaled its operations.")}}</p>

What about members of controversial political and religious groups? The personal leanings of a marketplace’s founders, no matter how mainstream, should not interfere with the decisions of marketplace buyers and sellers.")}}</p>

    <p>{{gettext("Many Etsy sellers live in constant fear of their stores being shut down for copyright violations or breaking arbitrary rules like having duplicate listings or failing to disclose team members. There are many stories of store owners having their livelihoods extinguished with little to no recourse. Similar stories of platforms shutting down accounts or seizing funds are all too common on eBay, Amazon, and many other popular marketplaces. Sellers complain of course, but few realistic alternatives exist.")}}</p>

    <p>{{gettext("Tampering of rules is not reserved only for private corporations that manage the marketplace. Airbnb’s home city of San Francisco has passed local ordinances forbidding the home-rental company from taking bookings from hosts who have not properly registered their homes9. The new regulations are so restrictive that thousands of rental properties in San Francisco have now been banned from the platform. Dozens of other cities followed San Francisco’s actions and used them as a model for how to pass their own restrictions concerning home-sharing. Airbnb represents a single point of failure in this case, and hotel industry lobbyists can attack this valuable industry easily and effectively.")}}</p>
