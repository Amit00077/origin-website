Thanks for uploading your bill to {{ universal.BUSINESS_NAME }}. We're super excited to help you fight back against the big guys and reduce the amount you are paying.

We've already assigned one of our trained negotiators to your case! Before we can call your service provider though, we need to know a couple more details about your bill, like the phone number and any pin/passcodes associated with the account.

{{ universal.BASE_URL }}/bill-additional-info/{{ encrypted_bill_id }}

This information is only used to confirm your account details with your service provider. We take your privacy and security extremely seriously.

If you'd like to chat about our bill negotiation process, you can reach a real human being on our website or by calling us at {{ universal.PHONE_NUMBER }}. Our entire team loves hearing from customers.

Thanks again,
The {{ universal.BUSINESS_NAME }} team
