New release of our demo DApp!

We have lots of exciting new functionality to show off with our latest release of the Origin demo DApp that is live on the Ropsten and Rinkeby test networks. We’ve crammed a lot of new features into this latest release, including user identity (supporting the ERC 725 standard), transaction steps, escrow, ratings, and reviews.

Please read our latest tech update to learn more about our progress with this latest release or head straight to our demo DApp (https://demo.originprotocol.com) to check it out for yourself.

In the last few months, we’ve had over 1,700 commits to our Github repositories and merged 340 pull requests from over 40 open-source contributors. Our progress is only accelerating, and we are on track for platform launch on the Ethereum mainnet by the end of Q3 this year. 

We owe a huge thanks to every one of our incredible open-source contributors who made this release possible. As always, thank you for your support of this project. Please continue to spread the word and tell your friends about Origin!
