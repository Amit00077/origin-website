We know it hasn’t been long since our last update, but we couldn’t wait to share some exciting news about Origin Protocol. You may have seen the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/another-paypal-co-founder-is-embracing-blockchains-seismic-shift/">news featured on CoinDesk</a> and other outlets or read <a href="https://medium.com/originprotocol/welcoming-yu-pan-to-the-origin-team-fcce3e3a2166">our blog post</a> about it. We are extremely happy to announce that one of the original 6 Paypal founders who was also the first employee at YouTube has decided to join Origin Protocol as our lead research and development engineer.

Please welcome <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Pan">Yu Pan</a> to the Origin family! To say that Yu Pan has been integral to building many of the core parts of the internet services we use on a daily basis would be an understatement. Yu Pan developed many of Paypal’s payments and eBay integration infrastructure. He also built the YouTube embedded video player which helped kick start the platform’s explosive viral growth. Both of these internet giants would not be where they were today without Yu Pan. Yu Pan also contributed to the growth of Affirm with his work on the ecommerce platforms spree and magento.
<br><br>
We are beyond thrilled to have such a talented engineer and builder join our team. To those of you who do not know Yu Pan personally, not only is he a passionate hacker-coder who knows how to engineer products that gain mass consumer adoption and love, he is also one of the humblest and nicest guys you will ever meet. We are very fortunate to have Yu Pan working on our overall growth and mobile strategies and we know he is very excited to be taking on new challenges in the blockchain space.

Cheers from Origin Protocol!
