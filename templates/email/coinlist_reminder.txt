On Monday we announced (https://medium.com/originprotocol/origins-next-funding-round-now-live-on-coinlist-147096f6a906) that are using CoinList to run our latest $6.6M fundraising round. Since then, we’ve been overwhelmed by the amount of interest received with thousands of investors from across the world signing up.

If you haven't started the process yet, register now on CoinList (http://coinlist.co/origin)

With only a few days left for the registration period, we wanted to send a follow-up post with some information on what to expect during the signup process, including:

 - A timeline of the registration and investment periods
 - What you’ll need to register and participate 
 - The step-by-step process you’ll need to go through
