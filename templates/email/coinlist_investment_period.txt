It is a big day at Origin!

We are excited to be working with one of the biggest names in our industry for our CoinList Round (https://coinlist.co/origin) of funding. Our 10 day registration period ended last night. During that time, over 7,000 interested investors requested over $125M in allocations. If you applied as an accredited investor in the past 10 days and were accepted through CoinList’s verification process now is your time to log into https://coinlist.co/origin to see your allocation and instructions for funding.

The investment period starts today at 9am PST (GMT-7) and lasts until the round is full. We’ve structured the round to give investors time to confirm their investments, but it’s still possible the round will fill quickly. Please don’t delay with confirming your allocation and sending funds.

Our goal is to maximize the amount of participants, so we are going about this round of fundraising a little differently. To learn more about how we chose our maximum allocation amount and what to expect during the investment period, check out our recent post on Medium.
