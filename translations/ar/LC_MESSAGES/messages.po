It’s the norm for these businesses to run at a deep loss in the early days. In effect, the corporation is subsidizing the usage of the marketplace for the participants. However, because of highly positive cross-side network effects<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote2'>2</a>, successful marketplace businesses are able to grow revenue exponentially over time, usually by charging a service fee for every transaction that happens on network. Network effect businesses, like sharing economy marketplaces, are usually winner-takes-all businesses<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote3'>3</a> and at mature stages extract a disproportionate amount of value from the network forthe managing corporations and their shareholders.

Already, we have had over 150 open-source contributors participate in improving our core libraries and initial marketplace DApp. There are multiple third-party DApps running on the Origin Platform across numerous verticals such as home-sharing, luxury ecommerce, and fine art."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "We see the Origin DApp as just the first way to interact with the Origin protocols and data on the blockchain. In the coming months and years after our 1.0 launch, we expect hundreds of third-party websites, mobile apps, and even new APIs to be built on top of the network."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "We intend to build a robust developer ecosystem that results in many successful third-party DApps. As blockchain and distributed technologies are still nascent and challenging to work with for most developers, Origin intends to release easy-to-use developer libraries that simplify the development process for third-parties.

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Note that this does not necessarily prohibit transaction fees charged by third-party DApp developers. Today, Origin Tokens are used as an incentive mechanism that provides third-party marketplace operators with a revenue stream via Origin Commissions. Sellers can choose to promote their listings, providing an optional commission to the marketplace operator that helps connect them with a buyer. While we expect these fees to be significantly lower than existing centralized incumbents, it’s important that marketplace operators have an incentive to build feature-rich dedicated experiences on top of the Origin developer libraries and protocols. "
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "We turn again to examples of highly verticalized sites (e.g. dog sitting) and regional players (e.g. bikesharing in Boulder, CO) as potential use cases that would benefit from a more specialized experience than what the default Origin DApp currently offers."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Today, if you wanted to start a traditional company to compete in the sharing economy, you would have to set up banking arrangements one country at a time and deal with all the related financial regulations. This creates a non-trivial barrier to entry for most startups looking to expand internationally. In fact, we often see regional clones who are able to launch faster in specific regions than the company that came up with the original idea. However, cryptocurrency is a global phenomenon. Thanks to the widespread availability of the Internet, the Origin platform and flagship DApp were immediately available in nearly every country in the world when we launched on the Ethereum mainnet. We view this as a significant advantage."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Even today, Origin Tokens are used to incentivize various forms of participation from the Platform’s ecosystem participants.

This OGN is placed into escrow in our Marketplace Contract"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Then, when sales are finalized, OGN commissions are given to the DApps that brought counterparties (the buyers) to fulfill the sales. This gives DApp developers an incentive to promote these seller listings, as well as compete amongst themselves to drive the most sales for sellers. "

Multiple home-sharing DApps are now incentivized to feature her apartment so that they can compete for the OGN commissions. When one DApp acts as the final point of sale for apartment bookings by finding the seller a renter, the DApp is rewarded the 20 OGN that she has offered up as commission"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Origin Commissions is a new advertising and promotions model that is superior to traditional paid marketing (CPC and CPM) models. Advertisers (sellers) only pay in OGN tokens when successful sales have occurred. Similarly, the publishers (DApp creators, bloggers, other affiliates, etc.) are only paid when real transactions happen. This creates a much more efficient attribution model than the one that traditional advertising offers. Origin Commissions aligns the interests of sellers, DApp creators, and other affiliates to promote listings to buyers across the Origin network."

Node operators will be able to stake OGN for the right to “do work” validating and replicating data across the system; as they perform these operations, they will be rewarded a pro rata share of OGN rewards based on the amount of work they do in every given node operation interval."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "We intend to launch this new initiative and use case for OGN because of the slower-than-expected rollout of Ethereum 2.0. We increasingly believe that we need to build highly-scalable and performant ways of writing and reading data from the blockchain that are not dependent on Ethereum throughput times or constrained by high Ethereum gas fees. Currently, having fast and reliable search within our DApp is very difficult to pull off when listening for blockchain events. As a result, we have built our first Origin Node, a search and caching layer, that indexes the blockchain on traditional infrastructure. However, if Origin sits in the middle of every search request, then we’ve become the centralized intermediary that we’re fighting so hard to disrupt."

We intend to use a staking and slashing model to achieve our goals in this area. Node operators that provide value to the system will be rewarded OGN.
