These third-party developer applications will take advantage of all or parts of the underlying Origin developer infrastructure and protocols. We intend to support fully decentralized applications, partially decentralized applications (e.g. applications that use managed wallets), and even mostly-centralized applications that are still focused on peer-to-peer commerce (e.g. applications that utilize the Origin Token for incentives that are hosted on traditional infrastructure)."
msgstr ""

As blockchain and distributed technologies are still nascent and challenging to work with for most developers, Origin intends to release easy-to-use developer libraries that simplify the development process for third-parties. By implementing an easy-to-use abstraction layer, we hope to attract many more developers that have experience in traditional web and mobile technologies, but may not be familiar with blockchain programming"

msgid "This creates several benefits. First, the corpus of data is open and immutable, which means it can be trusted without requiring the traditional third-party intermediary that imposes its “trust tax”. Second, it levels the competitive playing field and allows for new teams of developers, entrepreneurs, and organizations to compete with each other off of this shared data, and ultimately creates greater value for the platform. After our 1.0 launch, we anticipate that much of the development of the Origin Platform will come from third-party developers that make use of this open data layer."

msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:74
msgid "To recap, at a high-level, the Origin Platform and third-party applications built on top of it have several intended advantages when compared to existing sharing economy marketplaces."
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:76
msgid "Of paramount importance is the ability to cut out almost all of the transaction fees associated from bookings between buyers and suppliers. Because of the Fat Protocol phenomenon, the value of the network lies mostly in the value of the protocol layer<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote17'>17</a>, and less on the applications layer (in this case, websites that would otherwise charge fees). Our incentives are to build a rich ecosystem of buyers and sellers, so we do not intend to charge onerous transaction fees on the protocol level."
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:78
msgid "Note that this does not necessarily prohibit transaction fees charged by third-party application developers. Today, Origin Tokens are used as an incentive mechanism that provides third-party marketplace operators with a revenue stream via Origin Commissions. Sellers can choose to promote their listings, providing an optional commission to the marketplace operator that helps connect them with a buyer. While we expect these fees to be significantly lower than existing centralized incumbents, it’s important that marketplace operators and e-commerce merchants have an incentive to build feature-rich dedicated experiences on top of the Origin developer libraries and protocols. "
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:80
msgid "We turn again to examples of highly verticalized sites (e.g. dog sitting) and regional players (e.g. bikesharing in Boulder, CO) as potential use cases that would benefit from a more specialized experience than what the default Origin flagship marketplace app or decentralized e-commerce store creator currently offer."
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:82
msgid "Today, if you wanted to start a traditional company to compete in the global economy, you would have to set up banking arrangements one country at a time and deal with all the related financial regulations. This creates a non-trivial barrier to entry for most startups looking to expand internationally. In fact, we often see regional clones who are able to launch faster in specific regions than the company that came up with the original idea. However, cryptocurrency is a global phenomenon. Thanks to the widespread availability of the Internet, the Origin platform and flagship marketplace app were immediately available in nearly every country in the world when we launched on the Ethereum mainnet. We view this as a significant advantage."
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:84
msgid "Other high-level benefits include having a built-in mechanism to incentivize early ecosystem participants who hold and use Origin Tokens (OGN). We are constantly thinking about the right incentives that will encourage ecosystem participants like developers, individual buyers and sellers, and others to use and promote the Platform. We intend to reward behavior that encourages new referrals to the Platform and builds marketing, operational, and trust/safety infrastructure for the Platform. You can see these economic incentives in action with our initial implementation of Origin Rewards."

msgid "Second, most sharing economy businesses follow the same growth lifecycle. Save for a few exceptions, these marketplaces are notoriously difficult to start and grow. Marketplace businesses oftentimes require millions of dollars to just get off the ground and, in the case of Uber and Airbnb, billions to scale. It’s the norm for these businesses to run at a deep loss in the early days. In effect, the corporation is subsidizing the usage of the marketplace for the participants. However, because of highly positive cross-side network effects<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote2'>2</a>, successful marketplace businesses are able to grow revenue exponentially over time, usually by charging a service fee for every transaction that happens on network. Network effect businesses, like sharing economy marketplaces, are usually winner-takes-all businesses<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote3'>3</a> and at mature stages extract a disproportionate amount of value from the network forthe managing corporations and their shareholders. In many ways, they begin looking like monopolies once they reach scale."

This is valuable proprietary technology on the one hand. On the other, it is a wasteful use of time and effort to reinvent the wheel each time to create a new marketplace vertical. Consumers are also left creating and managing dozens of accounts on these marketplace companies, each of which owns their personal data and transaction history."

#~ msgid "Our vision is to promote the open and free exchange of services on the decentralized web. To do this, we have built a platform that replicates much, if not all, of the functionality of third-party intermediaries on the blockchain and other distributed systems. This is an ambitious goal and a technically difficult engineering challenge, but we have already hit early milestones to prove out our technology and early use cases."

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Today, there is one primary Origin marketplace DApp, though there are multiple vertical-specific DApps (e.g. in the home-sharing or services verticals) that are currently being actively developed."

#~ msgid "Users can use the Origin DApp provided they have the Origin Mobile app or an Ethereum wallet and a web3-enabled browser like Coinbase Wallet, imToken, Trust Wallet, or Metamask."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Of particular note is that we don’t intend for the Origin DApp to be the only way to access user and transaction data. Our code, protocols, and specifications are all 100%% open-source, and we expect and hope that others will extend and fork the code to create their own frontend experiences. Already, we have had over 150 open-source contributors participate in improving our core libraries and initial marketplace DApp. There are multiple third-party DApps running on the Origin Platform across numerous verticals such as home-sharing, luxury ecommerce, and fine art."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "We see the Origin DApp as just the first way to interact with the Origin protocols and data on the blockchain. In the coming months and years after our 1.0 launch, we expect hundreds of third-party websites, mobile apps, and even new APIs to be built on top of the network."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "To that end, we expect new and better user experiences that focus on specific verticals (e.g. home-sharing vs. tasks) or regions (e.g. Brazil vs. Switzerland) to be created that can drill deeper on custom features and localization. These third-party developer DApps may filter for specific parts of the shared data on the blockchain that are relevant to those specific markets."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "We intend to build a robust developer ecosystem that results in many successful third-party DApps. As blockchain and distributed technologies are still nascent and challenging to work with for most developers, Origin intends to release easy-to-use developer libraries that simplify the development process for third-parties. By implementing an easy-to-use abstraction layer, we hope to attract many more developers that have experience in traditional web and mobile technologies, but may not be familiar with Solidity programming"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "To recap, at a high-level, the Origin Platform and third-party DApps built on top of it have several intended advantages when compared to existing sharing economy marketplaces."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Note that this does not necessarily prohibit transaction fees charged by third-party DApp developers. Today, Origin Tokens are used as an incentive mechanism that provides third-party marketplace operators with a revenue stream via Origin Commissions. Sellers can choose to promote their listings, providing an optional commission to the marketplace operator that helps connect them with a buyer. While we expect these fees to be significantly lower than existing centralized incumbents, it’s important that marketplace operators have an incentive to build feature-rich dedicated experiences on top of the Origin developer libraries and protocols. "
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "We turn again to examples of highly verticalized sites (e.g. dog sitting) and regional players (e.g. bikesharing in Boulder, CO) as potential use cases that would benefit from a more specialized experience than what the default Origin DApp currently offers."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Today, if you wanted to start a traditional company to compete in the sharing economy, you would have to set up banking arrangements one country at a time and deal with all the related financial regulations. This creates a non-trivial barrier to entry for most startups looking to expand internationally. In fact, we often see regional clones who are able to launch faster in specific regions than the company that came up with the original idea. However, cryptocurrency is a global phenomenon. Thanks to the widespread availability of the Internet, the Origin platform and flagship DApp were immediately available in nearly every country in the world when we launched on the Ethereum mainnet. We view this as a significant advantage."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Even today, Origin Tokens are used to incentivize various forms of participation from the Platform’s ecosystem participants. Origin Tokens are used to reward users, developers, marketplace operators, and/or other participants to perform actions and services that are beneficial to the health and growth of the Platform. "
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Sellers on Origin-enabled DApps can promote their listings with OGN to get higher visibility on the search and browse results on our flagship app and partner apps. The only way to participate in this program is to pay with OGN. When sellers create listings, they can add OGN commissions to their listings. This OGN is placed into escrow in our Marketplace Contract"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Then, when sales are finalized, OGN commissions are given to the DApps that brought counterparties (the buyers) to fulfill the sales. This gives DApp developers an incentive to promote these seller listings, as well as compete amongst themselves to drive the most sales for sellers. "
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "To give a more specific example, let’s assume that a NYC-based home owner wants to put her apartment up for home-sharing on the Origin network. She inputs that she is willing to pay a 20 OGN commission every single time her apartment is rented out for one evening. Multiple home-sharing DApps are now incentivized to feature her apartment so that they can compete for the OGN commissions. When one DApp acts as the final point of sale for apartment bookings by finding the seller a renter, the DApp is rewarded the 20 OGN that she has offered up as commission"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Origin Commissions is a new advertising and promotions model that is superior to traditional paid marketing (CPC and CPM) models. Advertisers (sellers) only pay in OGN tokens when successful sales have occurred. Similarly, the publishers (DApp creators, bloggers, other affiliates, etc.) are only paid when real transactions happen. This creates a much more efficient attribution model than the one that traditional advertising offers. Origin Commissions aligns the interests of sellers, DApp creators, and other affiliates to promote listings to buyers across the Origin network."

#~ msgid "Today, users of the platform are able to transact using ETH or DAI. After our 1.0 platform launch, OGN will be enabled as one of the preferred payment methods between buyers and sellers on the platform."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "For example, users that earn OGN through Origin Rewards will be able to instantly use their tokens to purchase goods and services on our flagship app. This lowers the user friction of users having to acquire ETH or DAI outside of the platform before they are able to be viable buyers in the system."

#~ msgid "It is intended that this use case for OGN will be launched in Q4 of 2019."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "After our 1.0 launch, we intend to collaborate with our large community on a new initiative to ensure that Origin is a highly-decentralized but scalable and performant platform. We will incentivize developers and other participants to run Origin Nodes that store, update, and validate profile, listing, and reputation metadata across the decentralized web. Node operators will be able to stake OGN for the right to “do work” validating and replicating data across the system; as they perform these operations, they will be rewarded a pro rata share of OGN rewards based on the amount of work they do in every given node operation interval."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "We intend to launch this new initiative and use case for OGN because of the slower-than-expected rollout of Ethereum 2.0. We increasingly believe that we need to build highly-scalable and performant ways of writing and reading data from the blockchain that are not dependent on Ethereum throughput times or constrained by high Ethereum gas fees. Currently, having fast and reliable search within our DApp is very difficult to pull off when listening for blockchain events. As a result, we have built our first Origin Node, a search and caching layer, that indexes the blockchain on traditional infrastructure. However, if Origin sits in the middle of every search request, then we’ve become the centralized intermediary that we’re fighting so hard to disrupt."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "This is why we need to facilitate the creation of a network of Origin Nodes that is run by independent third-parties. Once there are multiple Origin Nodes, we need to ensure data consistency and validity. The Nodes need to communicate amongst themselves and verify that all node operators are “telling the truth” and “playing by the rules”. We intend to use a staking and slashing model to achieve our goals in this area. Node operators that provide value to the system will be rewarded OGN. Those that are unreliable or attempt to cheat the system will in turn be penalized and forfeit OGN."

#~ msgid "With the latest launch of the Origin flagship app, we implemented Meta Transactions to lessen the user friction required to use our platform. Previously, users had to pay $0.01 whenever they wanted to write data on-chain. This created friction for users that wanted to update their profiles or create listings. With Meta Transactions, Origin and third-party developers can choose to subsidize gas costs to bootstrap the network."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "We anticipate launching a system of Meta Transactions Relayers in collaboration with our developer community after 1.0 launch. Marketplace operators that want to use Meta Transactions may not want to deploy and manage their own relayers. Insteady, they would be able to pay for usage of Meta Transactions relay servers with OGN; subsequently, Origin or other relay server operators would write data to the Ethereum blockchain on their behalf. Relay operators would efficiently write data to the blockchain using Ethereum gas while earning OGN. They would earn a spread between the OGN fees they charge over the Ethereum gas fees they are paying"
