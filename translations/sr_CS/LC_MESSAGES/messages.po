msgid "To recap, at a high-level, the Origin Platform and third-party DApps built on top of it have several intended advantages when compared to existing sharing economy marketplaces."
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:76
msgid "Of paramount importance is the ability to cut out almost all of the transaction fees associated from bookings between buyers and suppliers. Because of the Fat Protocol phenomenon, the value of the network lies mostly in the value of the protocol layer<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote17'>17</a>, and less on the applications layer (in this case, websites that would otherwise charge fees). Our incentives are to build a rich ecosystem of buyers and sellers, so we do not intend to charge onerous transaction fees on the protocol level."
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:78
msgid "Note that this does not necessarily prohibit transaction fees charged by third-party DApp developers. Today, Origin Tokens are used as an incentive mechanism that provides third-party marketplace operators with a revenue stream via Origin Commissions. Sellers can choose to promote their listings, providing an optional commission to the marketplace operator that helps connect them with a buyer. While we expect these fees to be significantly lower than existing centralized incumbents, it’s important that marketplace operators have an incentive to build feature-rich dedicated experiences on top of the Origin developer libraries and protocols. "

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:80
msgid "We turn again to examples of highly verticalized sites (e.g. dog sitting) and regional players (e.g. bikesharing in Boulder, CO) as potential use cases that would benefit from a more specialized experience than what the default Origin DApp currently offers."
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:82
msgid "Today, if you wanted to start a traditional company to compete in the sharing economy, you would have to set up banking arrangements one country at a time and deal with all the related financial regulations. This creates a non-trivial barrier to entry for most startups looking to expand internationally. In fact, we often see regional clones who are able to launch faster in specific regions than the company that came up with the original idea. However, cryptocurrency is a global phenomenon. Thanks to the widespread availability of the Internet, the Origin platform and flagship DApp were immediately available in nearly every country in the world when we launched on the Ethereum mainnet. We view this as a significant advantage."

Insteady, they would be able to pay for usage of Meta Transactions relay servers with OGN; subsequently, Origin or other relay server operators would write data to the Ethereum blockchain on their behalf. Relay operators would efficiently write data to the blockchain using Ethereum gas while earning OGN. They would earn a spread between the OGN fees they charge over the Ethereum gas fees they are paying"

msgid "First, as a collection, these companies have created tremendous impact to the world. Consumers of marketplaces have been able to improve their lives with access to products and services that were not available previously.

Each marketplace creates a “home” for buyer and supplier to come together and transact, creating liquidity for that market."
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/why.html:24
msgid "Second, most sharing economy businesses follow the same growth lifecycle. Save for a few exceptions, these marketplaces are notoriously difficult to start and grow. Marketplace businesses oftentimes require millions of dollars to just get off the ground and, in the case of Uber and Airbnb, billions to scale. It’s the norm for these businesses to run at a deep loss in the early days. In effect, the corporation is subsidizing the usage of the marketplace for the participants. However, because of highly positive cross-side network effects<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote2'>2</a>, successful marketplace businesses are able to grow revenue exponentially over time, usually by charging a service fee for every transaction that happens on network. Network effect businesses, like sharing economy marketplaces, are usually winner-takes-all businesses<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote3'>3</a> and at mature stages extract a disproportionate amount of value from the network forthe managing corporations and their shareholders. In many ways, they begin looking like monopolies once they reach scale."
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/why.html:28
msgid "Finally, while there are very significant differences in user experience, business mechanics, and vertical-specific features among Internet marketplace companies, they all share many pieces that have been built and rebuilt many times. Lyft, Postmates, and DoorDash have each individually engineered their own solutions to user and supplier profiles, purchase experiences, matching algorithms, and reviews and ratings. This is valuable proprietary technology on the one hand. On the other, it is a wasteful use of time and effort to reinvent the wheel each time to create a new marketplace vertical. Consumers are also left creating and managing dozens of accounts on these marketplace companies, each of which owns their personal data and transaction history."

Sure, they benefited by making revenue on the platform, but they are not getting outsized rewards for their integral contributions in the early days of the marketplace like employees and investors are.
