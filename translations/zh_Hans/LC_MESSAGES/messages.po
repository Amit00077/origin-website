However, these marketplaces have always been governed by centralized companies that maintain their individual monopolies on data, transaction and other service fees, and ultimately, user choice. With blockchain and other distributed technologies beginning to hit the mainstream, the world is poised for a new wave of decentralized commerce."

msgid "Most sharing economy businesses have several things in common."
msgstr "大多数共享经济企业都有几个共同点。"

#: templates/whitepaper/why.html:23
msgid "First, as a collection, these companies have created tremendous impact to the world. Consumers of marketplaces have been able to improve their lives with access to products and services that were not available previously. Suppliers have used these platforms to reach customers at greater scale and ease than before. Each marketplace creates a “home” for buyer and supplier to come together and transact, creating liquidity for that market."
msgstr "首先，这些公司集合起来对全世界产生了深远的影响。市场的消费者已经能够通过获得以前没有的产品和服务来改善他们的生活。供应商使用这些新平台接触客户时，无论是规模还是方便性都更胜从前。每个市场都为卖家和买家创造出一个“家”，允许他们聚到一起进行交易，为那个市场创造出流动性。"

#: templates/whitepaper/why.html:24
msgid "Second, most sharing economy businesses follow the same growth lifecycle. Save for a few exceptions, these marketplaces are notoriously difficult to start and grow. Marketplace businesses oftentimes require millions of dollars to just get off the ground and, in the case of Uber and Airbnb, billions to scale. It’s the norm for these businesses to run at a deep loss in the early days. In effect, the corporation is subsidizing the usage of the marketplace for the participants. However, because of highly positive cross-side network effects<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote2'>2</a>, successful marketplace businesses are able to grow revenue exponentially over time, usually by charging a service fee for every transaction that happens on network. Network effect businesses, like sharing economy marketplaces, are usually winner-takes-all businesses<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote3'>3</a> and at mature stages extract a disproportionate amount of value from the network forthe managing corporations and their shareholders. In many ways, they begin looking like monopolies once they reach scale."
msgstr "其次，大多数共享经济企业遵循相同的增长周期。除了个别例外，这些市场非常难启动和发展。市场企业仅仅在起步阶段就往往需要数百万美元，以Uber和Airbnb为例，它们耗资数十亿美元才形成规模。这些企业在早期阶段的运营中出现巨额亏损，这是很普遍的情况。事实上，这些公司在为使用市场的参与者提供补贴。但是，由于强大的跨边网络效应<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote2'>2</a>,，成功的市场企业能够随着时间的推移让收入以指数级增长，而且通常是通过对网络上产生的每笔交易收取手续费。网络效应企业（如共享经济市场）通常是“赢家通吃”的企业<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote3'>3</a>，在成熟阶段为主管公司和股东从网络中攫取出搞得不成比例的价值。一旦达到一定的规模，他们从很多角度来看都很像垄断企业。"

#: templates/whitepaper/why.html:28
msgid "Finally, while there are very significant differences in user experience, business mechanics, and vertical-specific features among Internet marketplace companies, they all share many pieces that have been built and rebuilt many times. Lyft, Postmates, and DoorDash have each individually engineered their own solutions to user and supplier profiles, purchase experiences, matching algorithms, and reviews and ratings. This is valuable proprietary technology on the one hand. On the other, it is a wasteful use of time and effort to reinvent the wheel each time to create a new marketplace vertical. Consumers are also left creating and managing dozens of accounts on these marketplace companies, each of which owns their personal data and transaction history."
msgstr "最后，尽管互联网市场公司之间的用户体验、商业机制和垂直化特性方面存在非常大的差异，但它们都有很多一而再、再而三打造出的共同点。Lyft、Postmates和DoorDash针对用户和供应商配置文件、购买体验、匹配算法以及评论和评分各自设计出了解决方案。一方面，这是极具价值的专有技术。另一方面，每次在构建新的垂直化市场时都把轮子重新发明一遍，这是对时间和精力的双重浪费。用户也需要创建和管理很多不同的账户，而且所有的公司都拥有和掌控着他们的个人数据和交易历史。"

The company’s founders, venture capitalists, and employees will make an immense amount of money in an IPO that is anticipated in 2020. But what about Airbnb’s earliest hosts that supplied liquidity to the market? Sure, they benefited by making revenue on the platform, but they are not getting outsized rewards for their integral contributions in the early days of the marketplace like employees and investors are. In a somewhat exaggerated analogy, the company is running a feudal system where its hosts act as serfs to overfill the network owner’s coffers."
msgstr "此外，随着Airbnb的发展，获得巨大回报的是公司股东。公司的创始人、风险资本家和员工将在IPO或并购中赚一大笔钱。但是，最早加入Airbnb的房东(他们为市场提供了流动性) 从中又得到了什 么? 当然，他们也从平台中获利，但他们在市场的早期阶段做出了不可磨灭的贡献，却没有像公司的员工和投资者那样得到巨额回报。我们列举一个有点夸张的类比，公司就像是在运行一套封建制度， 房东扮演农奴的角色，让网络的拥有者赚得盆满钵溢。"

Having more buyers and sellers means more capital to further grow the business. Having invaluable troves of data, marketing dollars, and brand recognition are all powerful moats that prevent competitors from entering the market, thereby stifling innovation. The most salient example is probably Craigslist, the first mainstream services and goods marketplace on the Internet, which has thrived for over 20 years despite having an outdated user experience, lacking a dependable and trustworthy reputation system, and even failing to provide a native way to pay for transactions safely and easily<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote6'>6</a>."

The new regulations are so restrictive that thousands of rental properties in San Francisco have now been banned from the platform.
